## Quality Assurance

### Agent Output Validation
- Each agent must provide structured, consistent output
- All recommendations must include specific line numbers or file references
- Diagrams must be valid Mermaid syntax
- Issues must be categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

### Review Criteria
- **Code Quality**: Readability, maintainability, best practices
- **Architecture**: Design patterns, separation of concerns, modularity
- **Performance**: Efficiency, resource usage, scalability
- **Security**: Input validation, error handling, security best practices
- **Documentation**: Code comments, API documentation, usage examples

## Success Metrics

1. **Coverage**: 100% of source files reviewed and documented
2. **Quality**: All major architectural issues identified
3. **Actionability**: Recommendations are specific and implementable
4. **Completeness**: Architecture diagrams cover all major component interactions
5. **Usability**: Documentation serves as comprehensive reference for maintainers

## Timeline Estimation

- **Phase 1 (Parallel)**: 30-45 minutes per agent
- **Phase 2 (Consolidation)**: 15-20 minutes
- **Total Duration**: 45-65 minutes

## Risk Mitigation

- **Agent Failure**: Each agent operates independently; failure of one doesn't block others
- **Output Quality**: Structured templates ensure consistent output format
- **Scope Creep**: Clear boundaries prevent agents from expanding beyond assigned scope
- **Resource Management**: Parallel execution maximizes efficiency while maintaining quality

This plan provides a systematic, thorough approach to documenting and reviewing the entire twitch-chat.nvim codebase while leveraging Claude Code's multi-agent capabilities for maximum efficiency and coverage.
